OpenNI 2 Virtual Webcam - Directshow Filter

This application let you access output of any OpenNI compatible device using your favorite messaging, video calling application and any application that use DirectShow to access media devices or objects, including Skype, Live Messenger, Google Plus, ManyCAM, GraphEdit, any flash based video chat, etc.
NiVirtualCam is next version of old Kinect Virtual Camera which downloaded at least 23,000 times from my website alone. 


Features:
- Supporting Depth, Color and IR Streams
- Supporting Both Kinect and OpenNI compatible devices
- Auto device shutdown and wakeup depending on other applications' behavior
- Independent client and server design let streaming of data to all instances of our DirectShow filter within different applications. This also prevents cross access problems and minimizes any side effect of using OpenNI in host application like crashing and unrelated error messages.
- Supporting 1.2MP and 1.3MP resolutions.
